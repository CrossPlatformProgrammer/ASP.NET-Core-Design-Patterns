# Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. This section provides an overview of each category and the patterns included in this repository.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The main goal is to make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

### Patterns Included
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns concern class and object composition. They focus on how large structures are built from smaller components.

### Patterns Included
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically without modifying their existing code.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Patterns Included
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy**: Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime, encapsulating each algorithm in a separate class and making them interchangeable.

## Applying Patterns in ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core provides a robust framework for building modern web applications. Applying design patterns within this framework enhances code maintainability, scalability, and testability. Each pattern in this repository includes examples of how to implement them effectively in an ASP.NET Core context.

## Conclusion

Understanding and applying design patterns is crucial for building efficient and maintainable software. This repository serves as a practical guide to implementing these patterns in ASP.NET Core 8, providing real-world examples and best practices.
